# Catacomb-Crawlers-
This is the repository for my GDM VI Final Project. All updates and progress relating to my curriculum will be posted and updated here. 
Catacombs Crawlers is a Fantasy/Mideval Rogue-Like where the Player pilots the vessels of the various ressurected adventurers brought back to life by the Great Lich. As commanded by your master, you control these enthralled adventurers to do the Lich's bidding by entering & challenging the various dungeons which hold the artifacts necessary to unseal the Lich's true power. If the adventurer falls, no worries, there's always another fallen soldier who can be brought back...
